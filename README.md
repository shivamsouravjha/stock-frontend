# Stock Frontend

This project is a React-based frontend that allows users to upload `.xlsx` files containing stock data, stream stock information from a backend API, and display detailed stock information using styled components.

[Sample XLSX file here](https://github.com/shivamsouravjha/stock-frontend/blob/master/public/sample.xlsx)

## Features

- **Upload XLSX Files**: Users can upload multiple `.xlsx` files, and the data is streamed and parsed in real-time.
- **Live Streaming**: Stock data is fetched from the backend via streaming, allowing for real-time updates of stock information.
- **Stock Cards**: Stock details are displayed on individual cards, showing important metrics like ISIN, Industry, Market Value, and more.
- **Chakra UI Integration**: The project leverages Chakra UI for styling and user interface components.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend is built using React for creating interactive user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI**: For component-based styling and design.
- **Fetch API**: To handle file uploads and stream data from the backend.
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for handling file uploads and state management.
- **TextDecoder API**: For streaming and decoding stock data received from the backend.

## Installation and Setup

### Installation

This project uses Yarn as the package manager. Please follow the instructions below to get the project running locally.

   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Setting up environment variables

The project uses some environment variables which need to be defined inside a **.env** file at the root directory. Follow the steps to configure the .env file

1. Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.
2. Add the following variables

   ```bash
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
   VITE_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=<your-google-redirect-url>
   ```

   **If you want to use the sign-in functionality in the local development server, follow the below steps to obtain a google client id for you. If you don't need the sign-in functionality, you can assign a random text to the VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and VITE_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL environment variables, and all other functionalities will work properly without sign-in support**

### Obtaining google client ID

**step 1:** click [this](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) link and follow the instructions to create a google client ID.
When setting up, enter the following values in the respective fields:

- **Authorized JavaScript Origins**: http://localhost:5173
- **Authorized Redirect URIs**: http://localhost:5173

**Step 2:** Enable the Gmail API

Finally, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com) and enable the Gmail API. This enusres that your application can access Gmail functionalities as part of the OAuth 2.0 setup process.

## File Structure

The main components and logic are split into reusable hooks and UI components:

- **`useUpload.js`**: Handles file selection, validation, uploading, and data streaming from the backend.
- **`Upload.js`**: Provides the UI for selecting files, uploading them, and displaying the stock cards.
- **`StockCard.js`**: Displays the detailed information for each stock in a card format.
- **`StockDataStream.js`**: Fetches and streams stock data from the backend using the Fetch API and displays it.

## Usage

### Upload and Stream Stock Data

1. **Select XLSX Files**: Click on the "Select XLSX Files" button to upload `.xlsx` files. Only valid `.xlsx` files are accepted.
2. **Upload Files**: After selecting files, click the "Upload" button to start uploading. The system will display a spinner indicating that the files are being processed.
3. **View Stock Data**: Once the files are uploaded, stock details will be streamed and displayed as cards, with information like ISIN, Market Value, and more.
