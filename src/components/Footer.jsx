        <p className="mb-4">
          Our platform provides investors with insights into where mutual funds
          are investing their money. By leveraging mutual fund portfolio
          disclosures from Excel sheets or Gmail, we identify the stocks that
          mutual funds have invested in and provide detailed ratings based on
          multiple factors, including F9 scores and overall performance. This
          tool helps investors track mutual fund stock allocations and assess
          the potential of individual stocks.
